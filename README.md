# dmgextract

## Extract a DMG file. Currently only supports APFS, HFS(+) support is planned.

### HUGE thanks to the apfs-fuse project, which this is largely based on for the APFS portion.

### TODO

- Add HFS(+) support
- Find out why win32 is so slow
- Rewrite the win32 filename sanitizer, it's so bad
